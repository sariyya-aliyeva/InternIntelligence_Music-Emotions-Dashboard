# Music & Emotions Dashboard

**Music has emotions — and data can show them.**  
This Power BI dashboard explores how different music genres express *energy*, *emotion*, and *positivity* using Spotify's audio feature dataset with over **86,000 tracks**.

## Project Overview

As part of my internship at **Intern Intelligence**, I designed an interactive data visualization project that connects data analytics with the emotional patterns of music.

The goal was to analyse how various musical characteristics — such as **valence (happiness)**, **energy**, and **tempo** — differ across genres, artists, and popularity levels.
